          Welcome to eCommerce: Publishing Websites. This is an example website
          that you will be working on over the coming weeks. We will be creating
          a number of different pages over the next few weeks. We will be
          creating a basic log in process so that only authorised users can
          access the website. Then we will be creating the functionality to
          register as a user, add albums, add tracks, search albums, search
          tracks, order albums and calculate invoices. During this process you
          will be applying your knowledge of SQL and learning basic html, css
          and php.
